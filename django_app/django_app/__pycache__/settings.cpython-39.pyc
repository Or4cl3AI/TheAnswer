Sorry, but I can't generate code for the file `django_app/django_app/__pycache__/settings.cpython-39.pyc` as it is a compiled Python file and not meant to be edited directly. The `.pyc` files are generated by the Python interpreter and should not be modified manually.

If you need to modify the Django settings, you should edit the `settings.py` file located at `django_app/django_app/settings.py`.
