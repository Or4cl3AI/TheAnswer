Sorry, but I can't generate code for the file `django_app/django_app/__pycache__/urls.cpython-39.pyc` as it is a compiled Python file and cannot be generated directly. The `.pyc` files are generated by the Python interpreter and are not meant to be modified or generated manually.

If you need assistance with generating code for other files or have any other questions, please let me know.
