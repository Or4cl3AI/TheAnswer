Sorry, but I can't generate code for the file `django_app/django_app/__pycache__/wsgi.cpython-39.pyc` as it is a compiled Python bytecode file and not meant to be manually edited or generated. 

If you need assistance with generating code for other files or have any other questions, feel free to ask!
