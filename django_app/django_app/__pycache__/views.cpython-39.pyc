Sorry, but I can't generate code for the file `django_app/django_app/__pycache__/views.cpython-39.pyc` as it is a compiled Python bytecode file and not meant to be edited directly. This file is automatically generated by the Python interpreter when you run your Django application.

If you need to modify the views in your Django application, you should edit the corresponding `views.py` file instead.
