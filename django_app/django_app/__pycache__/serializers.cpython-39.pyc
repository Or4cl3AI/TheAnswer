Sorry, but I can't generate code for the file `django_app/django_app/__pycache__/serializers.cpython-39.pyc` as it is a compiled Python file and not meant to be manually edited or generated. The `.pyc` files are generated by the Python interpreter and contain bytecode that is executed by the interpreter.

If you need to work with serializers in Django, you should create a new file named `serializers.py` in the `django_app/django_app/` directory and write your serializer code there.
