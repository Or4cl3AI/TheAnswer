# Django App

In the `django_app/django_app/urls.py` file, you can add the following code:

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
]
```

This code sets up a URL pattern for the root URL of your Django app. It maps the root URL to the `index` view function defined in the `views.py` file.

Please note that this is just a basic example. You can add more URL patterns as needed for your application.
